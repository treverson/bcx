# Trading engine development repository

The bcx repository contains the master as well as development branches of the
Axlantic trading engine project. Each collaborator has writing and reading
permissions to their development branch while only the Axlantic account,
,administered by HÃ¥kan Holmberg, has reading and writing permissions to the
master branch.

## Git / Github instructions for bcx repository

These instruction will let you commit to your development branch of the bcx repository.

### Install trading engine dependencies

The trading engine project is based upon

In order to make a first commmit you need to do the following

### Accept the invitation from Axlantic with your collaborator account.

You should receive an invitation to collaborate from The Axlantic account
that you need to accept. Upon acceptin the invitaion you will gain access to you
development branch of the bcx repository. 
 
### Prerequisites

The trading engine platform should be developed within a virtual environment, in
order to keep track of dependencies. In order to setup a virtual environment you
need the python package virtualenv which can be installed by the following
terminal command:

```
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

You also need git. On ubuntu (linux), git can be installed by issuing the following command in a terminal.

```
sudo apt-get install git
``` 

### Clone the bcx master branch

After installing git you will be able to clone the master branch Clone from the
Axlantic. It is important that you positioned in the folder where you want to
store the project i.e., if you want to store the bcx repository in ~/dev you
should be postioned at ~/dev. To clone the master branch, issue the following
command in a terminal.

git clone https://github.com/Axlantic/bcx.git

This will create a local copy of all branches of the bcx repository, including yours, on your computer.

### Activate the virtual environment 

The bcx repository already includes a virtual environment so the only thing you
need to do is to activate it. In a teminal, postion yourself in your local copy of the bcx repository (for
example ~/dev/bcx) and issue the following command.

source env/bin/activate

You will now see (env) before your username in the terminal window. From now on,
we will continue to work in the virtual environment which means that all command
will be issued for the terminal that is connected to the virtual environment.

### Configure the git repository
Your local branch includes a git repository that needs to be configured. We need
to tell the Axlantic account which user that is trying to commit to the
bcx repository. This can be done by issuing the following commands the
designated terminal

```
git config --global user.name "yourusername"
git config --global user.email "youremail"
```

### Create your first test commit to your branch of the bcx project

Create a text file "misc.txt" in your local copy and add the line "My first commit" (and save it). After creating the text file issue the following commands in a terminal.

```
git fetch --all
git branch
```

Now you should see the master branch and it should be the active branch (first
line to printed). You need to switch to your branch which is done by issuing the folloing command

```
git checkout <yourbranch> 
```

Now you  are ready to commit misc.txt to your branch by issuing the following commands

```
git add . 
git commit -m "my first commit"
git push bcx <yourbranch>
```

Finally, go to the Axlantic account on Github where you should be able to see
your commit in the bcx repository.

The ` git add .` command adds all files in the repository for staging (a file
needs to be staged before it can be pushed). This is general not a goog practice
since it will always push every package that is installed in the virtual
environment. Instead, you should only stage the files that need to be pushed and
include a requirements.txt file that contains all dependencies. The
requirements.txt fiile should be located in the root directory (bcx in this case) To print a
requirements.txt file you install the freeze package and execute the command

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

# Useful git commands

If you are tired of always have to type username and password when you commit
you can save your login information issuing the following commands.

```
git config --global credential.helper "cache --timeout=3600"

```

This will makw Git store your password in cache for the number os second
specified in timeout.


# Starting the django development server  and inspecting the trading engine GUI

In order to start the django development server you need postion yourself in
bcx/django-gentelella/gentelella and execute the following terminal command
 to issue the following
command.

```
python manage.py runserver

```

This will start the development server and you will be given an output such as


```
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
June 20, 2018 - 12:53:59
Django version 1.10, using settings 'gentelella.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

```
In order to see the tradding engine GUI you simply copy the url (in this case
http://127.0.0.1:8000/) and paste it in you web browser.
